# AI-DataScience Weekends
This repository is a collection of weekly Lessons, Projects &amp; Case Studies for study group learning of AI &amp; Data Science.

We will be following Courses &amp; Projects from DataCamp. We will also look into practical steps in structuring AI projects from Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Yearning book

Other resrouces for this study group can be found this this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16VguIk4G9oApD9tv62pd9gxsZpGjuxxx?usp=sharing)

# DataCamp Projects
DataCamp contains Projects &amp; Case Studies to put theory into practice. We will be using these to get some hands on work on real data. Eventually, we will probably migrate to finding our own datasets and coming up with our own projects and ideas.

## &gt; Topics
DataCamp Projects cover various combinations of the following topics:

1. Programming
2. Importing &amp; Cleaning Data
3. Data Manipulation
4. Data Visualization
5. Probability &amp; Statistics
6. Machine Learning
7. Applied Finance
8. Reporting
9. Case Studies

## &gt; Associated Courses
These Projects are meant to compliment courses on DataCamp, so each Project will have a list of recommended prerequisite Courses you should try to complete before hand

# Python &amp; Setup
We will start off by using Python (can consider going into R or various languages should the interest arise) and get used to all the tools and packages for AI and Data Science. It is recommended to set up the following on your device before hand:

1. **Anaconda**: This is a great tool to manage Python Environments and Packages
2. **JuPyter**: DataCamp Projects make use of JuPyter Notebooks. This is also usefull for project collaboration and sharing.
3. **PyCharm**: IDE for Python development. Has built in Git management as well as integration with Anaconda Environment management.

# Machine Learning Yearning
This is a book written by the AI celeb Andrew Ng as a handbook for practical strategies for real world AI projects. It is based on his many years of experience in implimenting Machine Learning and AI strategies for companies and business ideas.

It is still in the _drafting_ process, so the pdf files in [this folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GsHXELMKClM-Ovhekrpv-JoP0IxRC02x?usp=sharing) are drafts subsections of the book as he writes them.
You can subscribe to his [newsletter](http://www.mlyearning.org/) to receive the drafts as they are written

# On the Cloud
On prem servers and self-owned hardware is becoming the old paradigm. Cloud is the _future_!

In later weeks, we'll start exploring how to set up AI & Data Science Projects and run them on Cloud:

* GCP
* AWS
