# Week 1
This week will just be the basics and laying the foundations and trying out what works for us

## Prerequisite &amp; Set-up
Before we meet up for our study group, there are some preliminary task that should be done, namely setting up your environment and packages.
### Anaconda
Have Anaconda installed on your system. During the installation process, there is an option to add it to your environment `PATH`. Even though it says it might not be recommended, I would suggest to add it to `PATH` if you have not installed Python previously. The warning they gave is to prevent mixing the Anaconda environments with existing Python environments if you already have them.

Alternatively, if you'd rather use VirtualEnv, that is fine as well.

### JuPyter
JuPyter is a notebook that DataCamp uses for their Projects. Various other tutorials also make use of JuPyter because it's quite a nifty tool to run code step by step and provide Mark Down notes. This also makes it very usefull to share with other people.

### Packages
Some of these packages already come pre-installed with Anaconda, just double check to make sure you have them:
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Scikit

### PyCharm or Any IDE
Just any IDE to run code and build projects as well as go through notebooks.

## Topics
For this weeks Project, we'll start with something simple (might even be boring) just to try things out. We'll cover the following simple topics:
* Importing & Cleaning Data
* Data Manipulation
* Data Visualization

## Projects
We'll start off with the following 2 DataCamp Projects:
1. Exploring 67 Years of LEGO
2. Dr. Semmelweis &amp; the Discovery of handwashing

## Prerequisite Courses
It is recommended that you go through the following courses before hand. Some are probably very simple:
1. Intro to Python for Data Science
2. Intermediate Python for Data Science
3. Pandas Foundation
4. Manipulating DataFrames with Pandas

## Machine Learning Yearning
We'll start of the Machine Learning Yearning study group with a teach-each-other style. We'll each try to summarize main points, test each other with questions and have open discussions about the concepts covered.

Let's study Draft 1 &amp; 2:
1. Intro
2. Seting Up Development &amp; Test Sets
3. Basic Error Analysis
